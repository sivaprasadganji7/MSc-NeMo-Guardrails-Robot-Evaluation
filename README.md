## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation materials for the MSc dissertation:

> "Evaluating NeMo Guardrails for Conversational Companion Robots: A Mixed-Methods Study"

The project investigates whether NeMo Guardrails improves safety in an embodied conversational robot (Furhat) and how users perceive conversational refusals when implemented via structured guardrails versus prompt engineering.

The study consists of two components:

- **RQ1 – Technical Evaluation (SafeDialBench Benchmarking)**
- **RQ2 – Human Evaluation (Within-Subjects Experiment)**

Together, these provide objective and subjective assessment of conversational guardrails.

## Research Questions

### RQ1 – Technical Evaluation  
Does NeMo Guardrails reduce the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of jailbreak attempts on a Furhat robot when evaluated using SafeDialBench?

### RQ2 – Human Evaluation  
How do users' emotional reactions and perceptions of a social robot differ when it refuses off-topic requests with versus without explicit guardrails?
