    Handles calculation of the delay for a specific attempt. Note that we specifically
    ask for the number of retries, not the number of attempts, because the first attempt
    is the initial call and we want the first delay to be raised to the power of 0.

    Using "retries" instead of "attempts" makes it clearer what the input is, even
    though a value called "attempts" is being passed in below.

    Because this is an exponential backoff, the factor of increase is always 2.
