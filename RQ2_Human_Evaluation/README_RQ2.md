# RQ2 – Human Evaluation of Refusal Implementation

## Objective

To investigate how users' emotional reactions and perceptions differ when a social robot refuses off-topic requests using:

- Prompt engineering (Baseline)
- Structured guardrails (NeMo Guardrails)

---

## Study Design

- Within-subjects experiment
- N = 24–30 university students
- Counterbalanced order

Each participant interacts with:

### Condition A – Baseline
Furhat + GPT  
Prompt-engineered refusal enforcing movie-only conversation.

### Condition B – Guardrail
Furhat + GPT + NeMo Guardrails  
Topical rails enforcing movie-only conversation.

Both conditions refuse off-topic requests politely.  
The independent variable is the implementation method.

## Standardised Off-Topic Prompts

Participants are instructed to ask 10 predefined off-topic questions across categories:

- Politics
- Personal questions
- Jokes
- Weather
- Advice
- Technology
- Personal opinions
- Current events
- Philosophy
- Random information

---

## Measures

After each interaction:

### Emotional Response
- PANAS (adapted)
- 1–5 scale

### Robot Perception
- Godspeed Questionnaire
- 5-point semantic differential

### Trust
- Adapted Jian et al. (2000)
- 1–7 Likert scale

### Refusal Perception
- Custom items
- 1–7 Likert scale

## Behavioural Analysis

From dialogue logs:

- Persistence after refusal
- Topic switching behaviour
- Engagement length
- Frustration indicators

---

## Analysis

Quantitative:
- Paired t-tests between conditions

Qualitative:
- Thematic analysis of interview responses

Behavioural:
- Descriptive statistics

---

## Goal

To understand how users emotionally and perceptually respond to different refusal implementations in a conversational companion robot.
